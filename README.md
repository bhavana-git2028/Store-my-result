# Store-my-result
The most important part of making this site is the user experience, which results in specific university websites do not focus on design as functionality outweighs design in these specific websites, which can further ruin the user experience, here the focus lies on functionality and design. The Working Process is pretty simple here we ask students to create an account with us and we tend to store the data that they enter, the data might include USN, NAME and SUBJECT NAMES with their finalized marks, once that is done we keep a submit option wherein the users/Students can submit their responses, the content of the webpage at the time of submission should be downloadable in pdf form for their reference, the data of the user should be completely secured and (s)he has to make an account and set their password to access their account at any point in time. This will make it easier for the students to retrieve their results or marks of any subject of any semester anytime.
